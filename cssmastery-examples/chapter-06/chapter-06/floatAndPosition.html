    <p>This is a fake article about spaceships. Remember when you did presentations in middle school, and you told the class about what your assignment was about, then read aloud from the paper you had written, including the title?
        ”My assignment is about spaceships. Spaceships. Spaceships are very large, and fly in space...”.</p>
